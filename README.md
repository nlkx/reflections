## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language that we learnt on our first week of lesson to create our own interactive stories, games and animation.  

### What is visual programming?
Is a sort of programming language that allows users to illustrate processes. It's for developers to explain the process in words that are understandable to humans.

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
Some principles that I have found on the internet.. 
1. Write programs for people, not computers. 
2. Define things once and only once.
3. Use a version control system.
4. Optimize software only after it works correctly.
5. Be a good code citizen.
6. Keep it short.
7. Language-specific style guides.

I still do not fully comprehend these principles and I hope I will be able to apply these as the course progresses. . and as I dive in more.

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?

## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is an Open Sourced Distributed Version Control System. Is a software for developers to use to store codes, track revision history, merge code changes and revert to earlier codes if needed.  

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. 

## Week 3:
In week 3 we did some coding practise to basic Python language syntax and practise doing some coding in the lab. We were provided with some activities but it ain't easy. I could only complete the first 2 activity.. and then my head started to hurt. I did some research online and found a phyton code execution for 1 of the activity, however I was still unable to comprehend as I wonder how did it know what to use when I have not been taught of that specific code. Now how do I stick the codes I've done onto my repository?  

# calculate a dog's age in dog's years

human_age = int(input("Input a dog's age in human years: "))

if human_age < 0:
	print("Age must be positive number.")
	exit()
elif human_age <= 2:
	dog_age = human_age * 10.5
else:
	dog_age = 21 + (human_age - 2)*4

print("The dog's age in dog's years is", dog_age)

# Convert month name to a number of days

print("List of months are January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December")
month = input("input the name of Month:")

if month == "February" :
    print("No. of days: 28/29 days")

elif month in ("April", "June", "September", "November") : 
    print("No. of days: 30 days")

elif month in ("January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December") :
    print("No. of days: 31 Days")

else:
    print("wrong month name")

## Week 4: Video-Graph
How did you feel as a subject of a video? Did you notice your ego? How are we evolving with this device? How could we draw this activity? Did you feel more attachment to the phone than to your image?

I don't think I was a subject of a video as we weren't able to see everyone's video. I definitely felt lost after this class. Even when Roman tried to elaborate it after the class, I was still @.@... definitely still at wonderland with what I'm going to do for my project. 

## Week 5: Agile Development Introduction
The class did a "Stand up" today and Roman got everyone in class to talk about what they did in the weekend and their ideas for their project. It's interesting to hear other peoples idea and what their concept for their project is going to be. Seems like majority already have it planned. I'm still clueless here... gg... 

I have finally thought of an idea for my project. I'm thinking of using the same concept Roman used with his story telling last week. I was thinking of doing a futuristic retro world where humans are ceased to exist and there's my cat wondering around trying to find me. I might still be alive, I might not. Kinda similar to the game "Stray" where the stray cat wanders around and interact with it's surroundings. But mine would just be to tell a story of a cat trying to find it's owner. Now how do I start? I can't even code yet... @.@. 

This week lab session we had to create the tallest tower using only spaghetti sticks, 1 marshmallow, a string and tape. We had 3 groups competing against each other. We weren't allow to google and we had to put our brains together to come up with a concept to get the marshmallow to stay up. It wasn't hard but it wasn't easy. The spaghetti stick breaks, the tape is not sticking, the tower is collaping. We first had it stuck to the ceiling, working our way from the top to the bottom. That was not allowed but it worked. We had a tower. 2nd attempt fail. It kinda stayed and then one of us accidentally touched it and fell to the ground. 3rd attempt, not the tallest tower but it stayed just good enough for Roman to take a picture and then it crumbled. It was definitely a fun activity I must say. Just wished we could have come up with a better strategy to make our tower more solid. After the class, I googled it and there was some really cool ones and they had more marshmallows. I believe if our resources also weren't so limited, everyone could make a cool standing tower. My husband is a builder, so instantly when you thought of building or making a tower, you'll need to have a strong foundation but it's different in software. You'll have to build from the top and keep pushing it to the top. Very interesting.

Roman was telling us that kindergarden kids would ace this and CEOs will fail. Cause kids are simple, they are told what to do and they just do it, they don't complicate things. Where as CEOs have alot of input and when you get alot of inputs at once - they can clash. Maybe I should try this with my son at home. 

## Questions from Roman...

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
Sure did.. during class I will take a moment to look out the window, seeing what's happening around down there while I'm up on the 14th floor. That's why I like to sit next to the window. I can stare out to the sky and look at the clouds. On the very first day of class, I saw a girl walking around barefeet with a blanket wrapped around her.. very strange.. a person approached her and seem to be helping her call someone and then they walked into a blindspot where I can no longer see them. I have a habit of clicking my fingers so.. and yes I did stretch. 

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
Ya, what is timeboxing? Why you no explain? ok so I just googled it and.... looks like its some sort of time management technique. I'm pretty good at time management.. sooo if I ever need to use it. I'll definitely try it. 

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
Definitely not confident. -0. 

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
That I know what python is. LOL but I still don't know how to code. Just with the 1st activity regarding the dog and human age, I had to google it and get a better understanding of how to decipher it. 


### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 
I feel like for me.. I don't always absorb information in the first instance. I'm not very good at listening sometimes, so for the lectures.. I will visit the recordings again. Which I think helped so much more. Thank god for recorded lectures. It was the same case back in uni. I get distracted easily as well and I loooooooooooove to procrastinate haha... and I feel like you get more out of something by doing it hands on instead of just words. I'm definitely more of a visual person with examples to make it more relatable.  


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Don't give up! it might still not make sense now but.. it will at the end. 

### What is Python?
A type of snake. 
Also a computer programming language often used to build websites and software. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialised for any specific problems. 

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
If I read a specific news article about a murder that happened.. I will usually google the murderer and check out what his/her life was before, how they were brought up and what led them to kill. Does that count as exploring? 

### Have you meditated before?
Yes, in my hot yoga class but those are very brief.. wasn't able to really free my mind and just think. I was all sweaty and feeling yucky. Just wanted to get out of there asap. 

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
Snowboarding. And I'm pretty good at those rhythm game. You play this game by pressing the correct keys on the keyboard along with the music. I do play games too. But it's MMORPG so I wouldn't say it's skilled based more like the items you have that makes you OP.

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
Definitely not. I can't even get past activity 3. I feel like I need to understand what those commands are in order for me to understand when it can be used and where to use it. 

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Who doesn't? it enables us to come up with new ideas and solve problems in innovative ways. People are attracted to new stuff, stuff they have not seen before. Stuff that is exciting or else people wouldn't be buying the new iphone each time it comes out. Creativity is an important part of our lives because without creativity we wouldn’t have the things that bring us so much happiness and satisfaction. When people express their feelings through art, music, or stories, they can share their thoughts and emotions with other people. When you’re creative, you find it easier to find good solutions and come up with new ideas. Creative expression is a tool you can use to solve problems and situations. 

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
I have 8 windows open and 36 tabs. 18 tabs is study related and 18 tabs is dstraction related. I'm surprised it's balanced. I would have thought I have more distraction tabs open. 

### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
Numerous times.. trying to sync music onto my itunes, it says sync complete but no music was on my itunes. Trying to answer this question but my eyes decided to stop focusing. It feels frustrating for sure when you think you're doing all the right steps but it's not going how it's supposed to. I overcome it by stopping everything. unplug and plug it again and try it all over again from the beginning. If that didn't work I will approach it in a different way/method. 

### What is an IDE?
From Google: An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. IDE makes it easy to see a visual representation of the files and makes it more understandable for the user.
All these are very new to me. 

### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?
It's ok to fail, cause everytime you fail.. you know not to use the same method you use the first time and try a different way until it works. 

### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
Tape was not secured enough and putting too much pressure while wrapping the tape around the spaghetti sticks and ended up breaking them. 
A team mate keep eating the marshmallow. 
Told the team mate to get more marshmallow and to stop eating them. Handled the sticks with TLC and we finally manage to get the marshmallow to stay until a picture was taken. 

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
Understanding how to code. I still have no idea.. I really hope I will be able to at the end of the course. 

### What is OOP?
From Google again: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterised by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
Not so much as I am more of a visual person, I tend to youtube or google first. When it's too much reading my eyes just go out of focus. 

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
reading.. reading.. and more reading.

### What is polymorphism?
Is the characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts - specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
My inner voice saying: Why am I not getting it? I dont undestand.. Will I ever be able to understand it? Or will I fail this class? I really don't want to fail this class... Why am I not smart? 
I just really don't want to fail this class. 

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
A product with minimum set of features to attract early users and validate the idea in the initial phase of the product development cycle. 
We're going to give you this keyboard that has a few cool features, it can play music, record what you played, lights flashes as you hit the keys and it you can put in any time of other noises you want. You'll need to tell us which feature you like the most from the keyboard and tell us if there's anything you think we can add to make the keyboard even cooler. 

### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?


### What is pair programming?
2 programmers team up together working on 1 computer. From Google: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
I want to be able to code easily and create softwares, websites from front to the end. To be able to program something useful and convenient for the user. 

### What is conscious listening?
From Google: Conscious listening is the process of listening to others by subtracting the fears, beliefs, expectations, judgments, and control strategies both within yourself and others from the process in order to understand the deepest motivations and intentions behind our words and theirs.
I am usually a very good listener when it comes to my girl friends dramas and worries, I may not be able to give good advices all the time but I'll always provide feedback and what I think she could do or not do and it's up to her if she wants to follow through with that. 

### What is a variable?
A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
I guess for now it could be Python. Since it will be the easiest to learn. I want to be able to atleast kinda master 1 programming language first and then slowly explore other programming languages. 

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?
The car infront of me thank me cause I let him/her cut infront. 
Just these little things really stood out for me. I don't think it's always about giving that is considered kind but the thought and the gesture.

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
Computer programming is a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions. If you're wondering what a computer programmer is, it's a professional that creates instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully.

### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
This whole course. I decided to take this course knowing nothing about programming and even from the start I'm already doubting myself if I will be able to understand the materials or if I will pass this course. But after starting the course I learnt that I need to embrace the fact that I'm not great at it yet and knowing that it is okay... 

### What is a fixed mindset?
A fixed mindset is like if I don't try new or hard things, then I won't fail. 
Not allowing yourself to grow or to take up challenges. Thinks that their intelligence and talent is fixed. Sometimes I feel like that... ahh just want to give up, I can't do this.. but then I get frustrated at myself for not being able to do it and so I get up and keep trying until I did it. The satisfaction you get from accomplishing it sure is sweet. Now I can snowboard.

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?
Just last week I offered to drop a fellow classmate off to where ever she needs to go because it was raining. 

### Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?
No I haven't. I have heard good things about it and that it uses sounds in a formal exercise to help us see thoughts, and our attention, in a different way, which will result in an increased ability to distance ourselves from unhelpful thoughts, and improve our ability to control our focus of attention. Maybe one day I will try it. 

### Have you developed a habit of persevering?
I will now. I am determined to pass all my assignments and this course. I use to just quit as soon as it gets hard. But now I have a goal and I intend to achieve this goal. I am going to force myself to stick with it even if I encounter any obstacles or setbacks. I'll just need to practise mindfulness and attention training to focus my attention on my goal.
