I got the site template from [HTML5up.net](https://html5up.net/) and then I tweaked how I wanted my site using visual studio code and it got me playing around with HTML (which is something so new to me) and so on this website, I get to display the Scratch projects I've done and you can see my weekly reflections and questions from Roman. It should be pretty easy to navigate.
